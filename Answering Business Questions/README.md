# Answering Business Questions with Chinook database
Introduction
The Chinook record store database provides valuable data for business analysis. In this report, I will explore four key business concepts using SQL queries:

Overview of Business Concepts
Business Concept #1
We will assist the store in selecting new albums for sale. To do this, we'll analyze the best-selling music genres in the USA to identify potential new artists to add to the store's collection.

Business Concept #2
We will evaluate the performance of sales support agents within the company. This analysis will help us determine if any sales agents are performing better or worse than others based on the number of sales and revenue generated.

Business Concept #3
An analysis of customer purchase patterns by country will be conducted to determine the total number of customers, total sales, average sales per customer, and average order value. This will provide insights for tailoring marketing strategies by country.

Business Concept #4
Lastly, we will explore customer purchase behavior to determine the percentage of purchases consisting of individual tracks versus whole albums. This information will assist in optimizing the purchasing strategy and maintaining customer satisfaction.

By analyzing these business concepts, I aim to provide actionable insights to help the Chinook record store make informed decisions and optimize its operations
