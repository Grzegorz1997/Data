# Comparative analysis of the macroeconomic effects of the crises on stock market indices

## Project Description
This project compares the DAX,NASDAQ and WIG20 indexes during 3 selected crises: the 2008 financial crisis, covid 19 and Russia's armed confilct with Ukraine.
The code generates charts showing the comparison of index prices during the selected periods, as well as their mutual correlation.
This code was written for my research, which I used in my bachelor's thesis to prove the high correlation of the main indexes during macroeconomic crises.
In the future I intend to use this code to create a more flexible analysis.

## Project findings
Chapter 3 of my thesis is devoted to discussing the results of the analysis
