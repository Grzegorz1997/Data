# Employee Exit Surveys Analysis
## Project Description
This project involves the cleaning and analysis of exit surveys gathered from employees of the Department of Education, Training, and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) body of the Queensland government in Australia. The primary goal is to combine the results from both surveys to address the following question:
Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?

## Objective
The central objective of this project is to provide insights into the reasons behind employee resignations, specifically focusing on the duration of their employment. By examining the exit survey data from both institutes, we aim to identify patterns and trends related to employee satisfaction and dissatisfaction.
