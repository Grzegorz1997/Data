Our primary goal is to identify indicators of heavy traffic, exploring various factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week. The dataset, provided by John Hogue, contains information about traffic and weather for specific hours between 2012-10-02 09:00:00 and 2018-09-30 23:00:00.
